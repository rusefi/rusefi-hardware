# ZF 8HP Installation Board

This repository contains KiCad design files, schematics, and Gerbers for a **ZF8HP installation board**, a drop-in replacement that **solders into the transmission in place of the stock TCU (Transmission Control Unit)**.

### ‚úÖ Supported ZF 8HP Models:
- **8HP45**
- **8HP50**
- **8HP51**
- **8HP70**
- **8HP75**
- **8HP90**
- **8HP95**

These models share similar architecture and connector layouts for the internal mechatronics, making the board compatible across multiple 8HP generations.

### üßê Notes
- While all 8HPs share ZF architecture, not all use identical internal TCU layouts or mounting methods. Minor variations may exist in the mechatronic design.
- This board was developed with modularity in mind and can be adapted for different generations as needed.
- Contributions are welcome to expand compatibility and improve hardware design.
