# Known issues

## DFU mode/floating PB2

BOOT0 = 1, BOOT1 = 0 pattern is used to enter DFU bootloader on power/reset. BOOT0 is controled by jumper/button. BOOT1 (PB2) is used as bias current source for LSU4.9 and floating.

Use jumper wire to connect PB2 (through bias resistor) to GND: connect A2 pin of main connector with GND (J4 AUX connector pin 10)

## ESR measurement crosstalk between channels (rev0 and rev1)

HW has three different outputs for Nernst cell ESR measurement with different output resistance: 6.8K for LSU4.2, 22K for LSU4.9 and 47K for LSUADV. Idea was to allow the user to set the type of sensor from SW only.

Each ESR output is driven by one MCU GPIO. GPIOs for unused ESR measurement outputs are kept in Hi-Z (input) state and does not affect ESR measurement.

Same GPIO drivers ESR outputs for both channels. **This is the root cause of problem**

Problem: unused ESR output with GPIO in Hi-Z state connect Nernst cell outputs from left and right channel through two resistors. This causes crosstalk between channels and inaccurate ESR measurement. Wrong ESR measurement causes incorrect sensor temperature calculation. This can lead to inaccurate AFR measurement, overheating or underheating of the sensor.

Same issue for LSU4.9 bias resistors R22 and R70.

Solution:

Boards come with all ESR drive resistors populated. You have to remove unnecessary resistors.

If LSU4.2 sensor is used: remove R24, R25, R71, R72, R22, R70. Keep R41 and R73 - 6.8K

If LSU4.9 sensor is used: remove R25, R41, R72, R73. Keep R24 and R71 - 22K

If LSUADV sensor is used: remove R24, R41, R71, R73, R22, R70. Keep R25 and R72 - 47K

This will be (or not) solved in next revision of HW.


# Pinout

## Connectors pinout

[Main connector interactive Pinout](https://rusefi.com/docs/pinouts/lambda-x2/)

J4 is AUX connector available on PCB. SPI and I2C interfaces along with 3.3V and 5V are routed to this connector. Can be used to connect some small disply (SW not implemented yet)

J3 connector is for flashing and powering board on table. Also can be used for TunerStudion connection.

J1 and J2 are JTAG connectos.

## Uart pinout

J3 connector. Colors are default for cheap usb-to-uart converters based on CP2101 or FTDI232
Connect red wire if you want to power device from USB.
Default baud rate is 115200.

# Bluetooth

No extra steps needed to initialize JDY-33. Default device name is "RusEFI WBO x2" (or "RuseEFI WBO x2 BLE" for BT BLE)

Default baud rate is 115200.

# TunerStudio configuration

Baudrate is 115200
[.ini file](https://github.com/dron0gus/wideband/blob/master/firmware/ini/rusefi_wb_f1_dual.ini) for both UART and BT connection.

Both interfaces can be used simultaneously for data logging but not for settings change (from rev1).

Rev0 share same UART for both interfaces.

# Firmware Upload

Two ways to program using STM32CubeProgrammer

* recommended way: using UART connectivity. Power device up while shorting BOOT0 jumper to enter DFU mode.
* st-link if you have tc2030 spring-loaded cable.
* update over CAN or UART (J3) using OpenBLT (update over BT is in progress)

TL,DR: 9600 nothing connected on main connector

## Updating over UART using DFU mode

1. Disconnect main connector. If you are going to apply +12V power through main connector - make sure that nothing else is connected to WBO (LSU sensors, any load, etc). But I recommend flash using +5V from USB.
   
3. connect USB to uart connector to J3 connector: gnd, rx and tx.
Don't forget to cross Rx-`Tx (adapter's Tx goes to WBO's Rx, WBO's Tx goes to adapter's Rx).
If you going to power WBO from USB port - also attach 5V line. Do not connect +5 from USB adapter if you are going to use +12V supply through main connector.

3. Download and install STM32 Flash Loader Demonstrator. (Alternative tool is stm32flash - not covered in this instruction)

5. Figure out USB to serial serial port number:

5. Start Flash Loader Demonstrator GUI application, select correct COM port. Optional: reduce timeout to 1 second:

6. Press and hold BOOT0 button on the bottom of PCB. Or short BOOT0 PCB jumper if button is not populated on your board.

8. Apply power (while holding BOOT0 button) to board and press Next in application.
After app detects chip you should see something similar to:

## Updating using JTAG

DBD.

## Update using OpenBLT

OpenBLT https://www.feaser.com/openblt/doku.php
