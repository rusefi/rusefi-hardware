* STM32F103 dual channel wideband AFR controller supporting Bosch LSU4.9 (LSU4.2 and LSU_ADV work in progress)
* CAN and analog output
* x2 EGT input using MAX31855KASA or MAX31856
* x2 auxilary analog input: 0..5V with pull-up or pull-down (configurable by soldering resistor). One can be used to source 5V to external sensor.
* x2 2 auxilary output 0..5V. Also can be used for slow PWM signal output.
* x2 open drain outputs: BTS3028 (5A)
* Bluetooth TunerStudio connectivity

# Known issues

## ESR measurement crosstalk between channels (rev0 and rev1)

HW has three different outputs for Nernst cell ESR measurement with different output resistance: 6.8K for LSU4.2, 22K for LSU4.9 and 47K for LSUADV. Idea was to allow the user to set the type of sensor from SW only.

Each ESR output is driven by one MCU GPIO. GPIOs for unused ESR measurement outputs are kept in Hi-Z (input) state and does not affect ESR measurement.

Same GPIO drivers ESR outputs for both channels. **This is the root cause of problem**

Problem: unused ESR output with GPIO in Hi-Z state connect Nernst cell outputs from left and right channel through two resistors. This causes crosstalk between channels and inaccurate ESR measurement. Wrong ESR measurement causes incorrect sensor temperature calculation. This can lead to inaccurate AFR measurement, overheating or underheating of the sensor.

Solution:

Boards come with all ESR drive resistors populated. You have to remove unnecessary resistors.

If LSU4.2 sensor is used: remove R24, R25, R71, R72. Keep R41 and R73 - 6.8K

If LSU4.9 sensor is used: remove R25, R41, R72, R73. Keep R24 and R71 - 22K

If LSUADV sensor is used: remove R24, R41, R71, R73. Keep R25 and R72 - 47K

This will be (or not) solved in next revision of HW.


# Pinout
